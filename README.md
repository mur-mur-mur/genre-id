# genre-id

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

this is a program that teaches us more about ourselves in a small and simple way.

anyone who has been asked about their taste in music knows that there is a gap in the way we talk about music genres.

bridge the gap by illustrating the genres of music you listen to in a way that conveys your preferences intuitively.
